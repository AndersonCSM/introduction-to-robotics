# Introduction to Robotics

A repository for learning and developing robotics projects.

## Overview

To understand the projects listed here, we use the following definition of a robot:

> A robot is an autonomous system that exists in the physical world, can sense its environment, and can act upon it to achieve specific goals.

## Projects

Based on this concept, the following robotic projects are listed, each incorporating this definition for specific objectives documented within each project.

### Current Robotics Projects

- [2WD Robot](Robot-2WD/) - Two-wheel drive robot implementation

## Simulators

The following simulators were used for project development:

- [Gears](https://gears.aposteriori.com.sg/) - Web-based robot simulator
- [Isaac Sim](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/use-cases/robotics-simulation/) - NVIDIA's robotics simulation platform
- [Cyberbotics Webots](https://cyberbotics.com/) - Open-source robot simulator

## Technologies
